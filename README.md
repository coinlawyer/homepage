# HOMEPAGE
---
This is the first of 3 tasks for the selection of students for an online intensive course 
on building web application in [Binary Studio Academy](https://academy.binary-studio.com/en) 2020.

Used [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) which helps to build a cool Service Worker for this website and it even works offline now. ðŸ’ªðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜œ 

Also made a pre-commit git hook, which automatically runs workbox and generate workbox-config.js before I commit 
and push my code to GitHub, so that I don't have to do it manually every time I make changes.

## Deployment
---
For study purpuses this site was deployed on [AWS](http://coinlawyer.github.io-homepage-production.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/) with the basic CI/CD process using Travis CI 
and [Vercel](https://homepage.coinlawyer.now.sh/) (former Zeit) with now.json. â€‹â€‹[Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations) also provides integrations for your GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket projects, allowing for automatic deployments on every branch push and merge to the default branch.
